# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates core **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques used to clean, transform, and prepare raw text data for further analysis and machine learning tasks.

The main focus is on **text preprocessing**, which is a critical step in any NLP pipeline. The notebook shows how unstructured text can be converted into a structured and machine-readable format.

## 🔄 NLP Preprocessing Steps
The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Text Cleaning**
   - Removing punctuation and special characters
   - Lowercasing text

2. **Tokenization**
   - Splitting text into words or tokens

3. **Stopword Removal**
   - Removing commonly used words with little semantic meaning

4. **Stemming / Lemmatization**
   - Reducing words to their root form

5. **Text Normalization**
   - Making text consistent for modeling
